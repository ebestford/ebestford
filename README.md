🧑‍💻 About me: As a professional with a diverse background in customer service and preschool teaching, I've honed a unique skill set in communication, problem-solving, and understanding human behavior. These experiences have given me a strong foundation in empathy, collaboration, and adaptability, essential qualities for any successful data driven decision making process.

Now, I'm channeling these skills into the world of data analytics, where I combine my passion for problem-solving with a keen interest in extracting insights from data. I’ve completed comprehensive training in data analytics, including tools like Excel, SQL, Python, and Tableau, and am excited to leverage these tools to help organizations make informed, data-backed decisions.

In my career, I’ve always been motivated by a desire to make an impact, whether it’s helping clients solve problems, fostering a positive learning environment for children, or analyzing data to uncover actionable insights. As I step into data analytics, I'm driven by the potential to make meaningful contributions to business outcomes and help shape strategies with data at the core.
